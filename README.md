## Responsibilities
Current project gave me possibility to consolidate skills that are required to senior developer position.

#### Customer
I would say that escalate issues in my own area is a typical part of your daily work. As a results - taking part in technical descussions, clarifications and analyzation requirements is a regular situation. It gives me an understanding of business processes, domain. You become independent, self-reliant and self-manager - "If you need something: go and take it". And at the end of each sprint, milestone, we put on demonstrations for product owners.
#### Project Management
The project has 2 week sprints at the beginning of each sprint, there is sprint planning and grooming. After each grooming session, the task evaluation process is started there i estimate my own stories and provide help with estimation for Nastassia. In a previous project, I help my teammates adapt to the BEM methodology, which I integrated into the styling process.
#### Team
On current project I helped Nastassia with onboarding and also I provided help for other developers were are start work on submodules.
#### Quality
One part of my work on previous project was created style guide for styling components using BEM methodology. Performs code review and analysis requirements for own area is a daily routine. Same to the quality of my technical solutions - working on code enhancement on free time.
#### Area of Expertise (Development)
It's a little funny, but I define the task by the time it takes to complete, instead of setting the difficulty level. So I don’t remember the task I couldn’t complete. I am often asked to help find a bug or help with html/css (sometimes floating elements are a pain in...). Most of my experience is with hybrid mobile app development. One of the interesting tasks was the easter egg in our Ionic app.
#### Expertise
Basically all my free time I devote to video tutorials or small, not obvious thoughts about the code. And I love to share these thoughts with my teammates (especially Andrey). I even set up a Skype group chat in the Grodno office to discuss some solutions or interesting topics I found. The last such topic was about 16bit JS. I was involved in the technical interview and was a mentor for junior employee in the local office. Often I take part in R&D projects.
